# Boston Housing Price Prediction

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates a basic workflow for predicting Boston housing prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this analysis is the Boston Housing Prices dataset.

## Overview

The notebook performs the following tasks:

1. Data Loading: Loads the dataset from a CSV file using the Pandas library.

2. Data Preprocessing: Cleans the data by removing any unnecessary rows and renaming columns.

3. Data Exploration: Explores the dataset by checking for missing values and visualizing data relationships.

4. Feature Selection: Prepares the features and target variable for modeling.

5. Data Splitting: Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.

6. Feature Scaling: Standardizes the features using the StandardScaler from scikit-learn.

7. Model Training: Utilizes the ElasticNet regression model for prediction.

8. Model Evaluation: Measures the performance of the model using the R-squared metric.

9. Prediction: Makes predictions, including an example prediction for a specific data point.

10. Model Serialization: Saves the trained model using the Pickle library.

11. Model Deserialization: Loads the saved model and makes predictions.
